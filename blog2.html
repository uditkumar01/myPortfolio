          The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called
          the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect
          on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, according to
          general relativity it has no locally detectable features.[4] In many
          ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no
          light.[5][6] Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime
          predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same
          spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to
          its mass. This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin
          for black holes of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible to
          observe directly. <br /><br />

          Once having entered the tumultuous orbit of a black hole, nothing can
          break away from its passionate but fatal embrace. Though cons of
          teasing play may be granted the doomed, ultimately play turns to prey
          and all are sucked haplessly―brilliantly aglow, true, but oh so
          briefly so―into the fire-breathing maw of oblivion.

          but oh so briefly so―into the fire-breathing maw of oblivion. Black
          holes, which have no memory, are said to contain the earliest memories
          of the universe, and the most recent, too, while at the same time
          obliterating all memory by obliterating all its embodiments. Such
          paradoxes characterize these strange galactic monsters, for whom
          creation is destruction, death life, chaos order.Try out this link for some quotes:
